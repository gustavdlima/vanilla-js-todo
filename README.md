# vanilla-js-todo
a todo app made with javascript html and css

> Set up an array where we’ll place the todo list items.

> Each todo item will be an object with three properties: text, a string which holds whatever the user types into the text input, checked, a boolean which helps us know if a task has been marked completed or not, and id, a unique identifier for the item.

> Once a new task is added, we’ll create a new todo object, push it into the array and render the value of the text property on the screen.

> When a todo is marked as completed, we’ll toggle the checked property to true, and when the user deletes a todo, we’ll locate the todo item in the array using its id and remove it.
